# dungeon_platformer
I decided to take a stab at game development, and thus I created a simple platform pixel game using the SDL2 library. 

My goal, per say, for the game was to recreate a small aspect of what could of been a much larger
platformer. I decided to work with a dungeon-like map where the player would simply collect coins using
basic movements, such as jumping and crouching. Adhering to the traditional style, there are, of course,
traps implemented into the game, such as spikes and lava. And that's about it. Though it may seem simple,
the goal was to create a small working pixel game with the idea of having the potential of building off of it
and creating a larger game now that I have the basics covered.
